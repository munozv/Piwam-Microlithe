When sharing a new version, think about...

# SVN
-----

    1) Merge current branch with trunk once you're sure your work is working
    
       > svn merge -r x:HEAD branches/1.2 trunk


# SQL
-----

    1) Be sure that SQL files do not refers to a specific db name. IE, check
       that no table are written as `piwam`.`piwam_table`.
       
    2) Be sure that /piwam/install.sql is up to date
        * piwam_data.dbversion = CURRENT_VERSION
